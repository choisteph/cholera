* "Unstacks" the data in two ways to make analysis and visualization easier and more meaningful.
* Computes and visualizes "pump neighborhoods" based on Euclidean distance (Voronoi tessellation) and walking distance.
* Overlay graphical elements and features like kernel density estimates, Voronoi diagrams, Snow's Broad Street neighborhood, and notable landmarks (John Snow's residence, the Lion Brewery, etc.) via `add*()` functions.
* Includes a variety of functions to find and highlight cases, roads, pumps and paths.
* Appends street names to the `roads` data set.

* Adds two aggregate time series fatalities data sets, taken from the Vestry report.

### getting started

To install 'cholera' from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cholera")
```

To install the current development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Note that you may need to install the 'devtools' package:
# install.packages("devtools")

# For 'devtools' (< 2.0.0)
devtools::install_github("lindbrook/cholera", build_vignettes = TRUE)

# For 'devtools' (>= 2.0.0)
devtools::install_github("lindbrook/cholera", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))
```

### warning message

With R version 3.6.0, you may see the warning below when loading 'cholera':

```
> library(cholera)
Registered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggplot2':
  method         from
  [.quosures     rlang
  c.quosures     rlang
  print.quosures rlang
```

My understanding is that it's more annoying than problematic. It's fixed in 'ggplot2' version >= 3.2.0. If it's not yet on CRAN, install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# For 'devtools' (>= 2.0.0)
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))
```

## background

John Snow's map of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London, which appeared in _On The Mode Of Communication Of Cholera_, is one of the best known examples of data visualization and information design:

![](vignettes/msu-snows-mapB.jpg)

By plotting the number and location of fatalities on a map, Snow was able to a perform a task that is easily taken for granted today: visualizing a spatial distribution. Looking at the results with our modern eye, the pattern on the map seems unmistakable, if not self-evident. The map appears to support Snow's claims that cholera is a waterborne disease and that the pump on Broad Street is the source of the outbreak. And yet, despite its virtues, the map failed to convince either the authorities or Snow's colleagues in the medical and scientific communities. Even today, many are skeptical of this or any map's ability to demonstrate such claims.

Beyond considerations of time and place, what critics past and present are picking up on is the fact that a concentration of cases around the Broad Street pump alone is not convincing. To put it differently, as is the map does not refute the primary rival explanation to waterborne transmission: the pattern we see is not unlike what airborne transmission (miasma theory) might look like. And while the presence of a pump at or near the epicenter of the distribution of fatalities is strong circumstantial evidence, it is nonetheless circumstantial.

### pump neighborhoods

This may be the reason why Snow added a graphical annotation to a second lesser-known version of the map:^[ _Report On The Cholera Outbreak In The Parish Of St. James, Westminster, During The Autumn Of 1854_]

![](vignettes/fig12-6.png)

Despite its hand-drawn, back-of-the-envelope appearance, Snow writes: "The inner dotted line on the map shews [sic] the various points which have been found by careful measurement to be at an equal distance by the nearest road from the pump in Broad Street and the surrounding pumps ..." (Ibid., p. 109.). In other words, guided by the principle that all else being equal people tend to choose the closest pump Snow is computing a _pump neighborhood_: the set of addresses or locations defined by their relative proximity to a specific water pump. By identifying the neighborhood of the Broad Street pump, Snow's annotation sets limits on where we should and should _not_ find fatalities. In short, Snow's annotation is a hypothesis or prediction.

## computing pump neighborhoods

While the specifics of his data and method of computation appear to be lost to history, I reverse engineer what I consider to be his approach by doing the following. First, from the quotation above I infer that his measure of proximity is the walking distance along the streets of Soho.^[The computation of walking distance is by no means new (see Shiode, 2012). Another approach is to use GIS. For applications that don't need to consider the actual historic walking distances, this layers-based approach, which typically relies on current maps, may be sufficient: e.g., https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map.] Second, putting aside aside questions about the map's accuracy,^[The map is actually a commercial map that Snow annotated.] which might be excellent, I set the map to be the definitive "text" and de facto source of data.^[I use a modified version of Dodson and Tobler's 1992 digitization. Each bar and each pump is assigned a unique x-y coordinate. Each road is translated into a series of straight line segments, defined by those segments' endpoints. While the original data, http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/pubs/snow/snow.html, are no longer available, they are preserved in Michael Friendly's 'HistData' package. Note that a future version of this package will re-digitize and geocode the map.] I then write functions to compute and visualized walking distances on the map.

The value of these functions goes beyond replicating and validating Snow's methods. By creating counterfactual scenarios by computing hypothetical neighborhoods via the selective inclusion or exclusion of pumps or by considering additional measures of proximity (e.g., Euclidean), we can better assess the ability of the map to test Snow's claims.

## walking v. Euclidean neighborhoods

While walking distanced based neighborhoods are based on paths that follow streets, Euclidean distance based neighborhoods are based on straight line paths between a location and the nearest (or selected):

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
streetNameLocator(zoom = 1, cases = NULL, highlight = FALSE, add.subtitle = FALSE, add.title = FALSE)
title(main = "Walking Distances")
invisible(lapply(c(1, 191, 46, 363, 85), addWalkingPath))

streetNameLocator(zoom = 1, cases = NULL, highlight = FALSE, add.subtitle = FALSE, add.title = FALSE)
title(main = "Euclidean Distances")
invisible(lapply(c(1, 191, 46, 363, 85), addEuclideanPath))
```

To build a neighborhood, we apply this algorithm to each location or "address" with at least one observed fatality. This builds the "observed" neighborhoods:

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
plot(neighborhoodWalking())
plot(neighborhoodEuclidean())
```

Ultimately, for testing purposes we also want the "expected" neighborhoods. For walking neighborhoods, I use the same approach but use simulated data. Using `sp::spsample()` and `sp::Polygon()`, I place 20,000 regularly spaced points, which lie approximately 6 meters apart, `unitMeter(dist(regular.cases[1:2, ]))`, across the face of the map and then compute the shortest path to the nearest pump.^[These data are found in `regular.cases` data frame. Note that because the map is not rectangular, there are only 19,993 cases.] For Euclidean neighborhoods, we can compute Voronoi diagrams.^[http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-voronoi]

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(case.set = "expected"), "area.polygons")

plot(neighborhoodVoronoi())
```

### Walking neighborhoods

To explore "observed" walking neighborhoods, use `neighborhoodWalking()` with the `pump.select` argument:

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(6:7))
plot(neighborhoodWalking(-7))
```

To explore "expected" walking neighborhoods, add case.set = "expected" argument:

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(6:7, case.set = "expected"), type = "area.polygons")
plot(neighborhoodWalking(-7, case.set = "expected"), type = "area.polygons")
```

### Euclidean neighborhoods

To explore "observed" Euclidean neighborhoods, use `neighborhoodEuclidean()` with the `pump.select` argument:

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
plot(neighborhoodEuclidean(6:7))
plot(neighborhoodEuclidean(-7))
```

To explore "expected" Euclidean neighborhoods, use `neighborhoodVoronoi()` with the `pump.select` argument:

```{r, fig.align = "default", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
plot(neighborhoodVoronoi(6:7))
plot(neighborhoodVoronoi(-7))
```

### note on `neighborhoodWalking()` and `neighborhoodEuclidean()`

`neighborhoodWalking()` and `neighborhoodEuclidean()` are computationally intensive. Using R version 3.6.0 on a single core of a 2.3 GHz Intel i7, plotting observed paths to PDF takes about 4.4 seconds; doing the same for expected paths takes about 27 seconds. Using the function's parallel implementation on 4 physical (8 logical) cores, the times fall to about 3.9 and 12 seconds.

Note that parallelization is currently only available on Linux and Mac.

Also, note that although some precautions are taken in R.app on macOS, the developers of the 'parallel' package, which `neighborhoodWalking()` uses, strongly discourage against using parallelization within a GUI or embedded environment. See `vignette("parallel")` for details.

### vignettes

The vignettes, which are available in the package as well as online at the links below, go into detail on a variety of topics.

[Duplicate and Missing Cases](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/vignettes/duplicate.missing.cases.md) describes the two coding errors and three misplaced cases I argue are present in Dodson and Tobler's (1992) digitization of Snow's map. Documentation and details about the fix are found online in ["Note on Duplicate and Missing Cases"](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/notes/duplicate.missing.cases.notes.md).

["Unstacking" Bars](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/vignettes/unstacking.bars.md) discusses the inferential and visual importance of "unstacking" the bars in Snow's map and the two "unstacked" data sets, which use "fatalities" and "addresses" as the units of observation.

[Roads](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/vignettes/roads.md) covers issues related to roads. This includes discussion of how and why I move pump #5 from Queen Street (I) to Marlborough Mews, the overall structure of the `roads` data set, "valid" road names, and my back of the envelope translation from the map's nominal scale to meters (and yards).

[voronoiPolygons(): Tiles, Triangles and Polygons](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/vignettes/tiles.polygons.md) focuses on the `voronoiPolygons()`, which extracts the vertices of triangles (Delauny triangulation) and tiles (Dirichelet or Voronoi tessellation) from `deldir::deldir()` for use with polygon() and related functions.

[Kernel Density Plot](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/vignettes/kernel.density.md) discusses the the syntax of `addKernelDensity()`, which allows you to define "populations" and subsets of pumps. This syntax is used in many of the functions in 'cholera'.

[Time Series](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/vignettes/time.series.md) discusses functions and data related to fatalities time series data and the question of the effect of the removal of the handle from the Broad Street pump.

### lab notes

The lab notes, which are only available online, go into greater detail about some of the issues and topics discussed in the vignettes:

[note on duplicate and missing cases](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/notes/duplicate.missing.cases.notes.md) documents the specifics of how I "fixed" two apparent coding errors and three misplaced case in Dodson and Tobler's data.

[computing street addresses](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/notes/unstacking.bars.notes.md) discusses how I use orthogonal projection and hierarchical cluster analysis to "unstack" bars and compute a stack's "address".

[Euclidean v. Voronoi neighborhoods](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/notes/euclidean.voronoi.md) discusses why there are separate functions for `neighborhoodEuclidean()` and `neighborhoodVoronoi()`.

[points v. polygons](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/notes/pump.neighborhoods.notes.md) discusses the tradeoff between using points() and polygon() to plot "expected" area neighborhood plots and the computation of polygon vertices.

[references](https://github.com/lindbrook/cholera/blob/master/docs/notes/references.md) is an informal list of articles and books about cholera, John Snow and the 1854 outbreak.
