### cholera: amend, augment and aid analysis of John Snow's 1854 cholera data

John Snow's map of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London is one of the best known examples of data visualization and information design.

![](vignettes/msu-snows-mapB.jpg)

By plotting the number and location of fatalities on a map, Snow was able to do something that is easily taken for granted today: the ability to create and disseminate a visualization of a spatial distribution. To our modern eye, the pattern is unmistakable. It seems self-evident that the map elegantly supports Snow's claims: cholera is a waterborne disease and the pump on Broad Street is the source of the outbreak. And yet, despite its virtues, the map failed to convince both the authorities and Snow's colleagues in the medical and scientific communities.

Beyond considerations of time and place, I would suggest that there are also "scientific" reasons why the map failed (and fails) to impress. The map shows a concentration of cases around the Broad Street pump. But that alone is not evidence of cholera's waterborne nature or of the Broad Street pump's culpability. The map doesn't refute Snow's primary rival, miasma theory, and the distributional pattern we see is not unlike what airborne transmission might look like. Moreover, while the presence of a pump near or at the epicenter of the distribution of fatalities is strong circumstantial evidence, it is still circumstantial. There are a host of rival explanations (right or wrong) that the map doesn't consider: location of sewer grates, elevation, weather patterns, etc.)

In fact, I would argue that this may be one reason why Snow added a graphical annotation in a second, lesser-known version of the map that was published in the official report on the outbreak:

### pump neighborhoods

This annotation outlines what we might call the Broad Street _pump neighborhood_: the set of addresses that are, according to Snow, within "close" walking distance to the pump. The notion of a pump neighborhood is important because it provides a prediction about where we should and where we should _not_ expect to find cases. If water is cholera's mode of transmission and if water pumps are the primary source of drinking water, then most, if not all, fatalities should be found _within_ the pump neighborhood. The disease should stop at the neighborhood's borders.

To identify the neighborhood of the Broad Street pump, Snow implicitly needs to identify the neighborhoods of surrounding pumps: the boundary of the Broad Street neighborhood is defined by the points where the distance between the Broad Street pump equals the distance to another pump. Building on Snow's efforts, I do this explicitly. I write functions that compute two types of pump neighborhoods.

The first type is based on Voronoi tessellation. It works by computing the Euclidean distances between pumps. While popular and easy to compute, its drawback is that roads and walking distance actually play no role in the choice of pump. The method assumes that people can walk through walls to get to their preferred pump.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(cholera)
```

```{r voronoi, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodVoronoi())
addLandmarks()
```

The second type is based on "actual" walking distance. While more accurate, it's computationally more demanding: I transform the roads on the map into a network graph and turn the computation of walking distance into a graph theory problem. For each case (observed or simulated), I compute the shortest path, weighted by road distance, to the nearest pump. Then by applying the "rinse and repeat" principle, the different pump neighborhoods emerge:

```{r walk, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodWalking())
addLandmarks()
```

To explore the data, you can consider a variety of scenarios by computing neighborhoods using any subset of pumps. Here's the result excluding the Broad Street pump.

```{r walk7, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(-7))
```

You can also explore "expected" neighborhoods:

```{r expected, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(case.set = "expected"))
```

Or highlight the area of "expected" neighborhoods:

```{r expected_area, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, message = FALSE}
plot(neighborhoodWalking(case.set = "expected"), area = TRUE)
```

### other package features

* Fixes three apparent coding errors in Dodson and Tobler's 1992 digitization of Snow's map.
* "Unstacks" the data in two ways to improve analysis and visualization.
* Adds the ability to overlay graphical features like kernel density, Voronoi diagrams, Snow's annotation, and notable landmarks (John Snow's residence, the Lion Brewery, etc.).
* Includes a variety of functions to find and locate cases, roads, pumps and walking paths.
* Appends actual street names to the roads data set.
* Includes the revised pump data used in the second version of Snow's map from the Vestry report. This includes the corrected location of the Broad Street pump.
* Adds two different aggregate time series fatalities data sets, taken from the Vestry report.

### getting started

To install "cholera"" (v. 0.2.1) from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cholera")
```

To install the current development version (v. 0.2.9.9018) from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Note that you may need to install the 'devtools' package:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lindbrook/cholera", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Read the package's vignettes. They include detailed discussions about the data, the functions and the methods used to "fix" the data and to compute walking distances and neighborhoods.

### note

neighborhoodWalking() is computationally intensive. Using the development version on a single core of a 2.3 GHz Intel i7, plotting observed paths takes about 8 seconds while expected paths takes about 35 seconds. When using the function's parallel implementation, these times fall to approximately 6 and 15 seconds using 4 physical or 8 logical cores.

Note that the parallelized version is currently only available on Linux and Mac. Also, note that the developers of the 'parallel' package strongly discourage against using paralleization within a GUI or embedded environment.
