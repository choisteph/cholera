\title{Compute walking path from anchor cases to nearest pump (or from among selected pumps).}
\usage{
nearestPath(pump.select = NULL, vestry = FALSE, weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pump.select}{Numeric. Default is NULL: all pumps are used. Otherwise, selection by a vector of numeric IDs: 1 to 13 for \code{pumps}; 1 to 14 for \code{pumps.vestry}. Negative selection allowed.}

\item{vestry}{Logical. TRUE uses the 14 pumps from the Vestry Report. FALSE uses the 13 in the original map.}

\item{weighted}{Logical. TRUE computes shortest path in terms of road length. FALSE computes shortest path in terms of the number of nodes.}
}
\value{
A R list of vectors of nodes.
