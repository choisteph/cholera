\title{Plot Euclidean path pump neighborhoods.}
\usage{
neighborhoodEuclidean(pump.select = NULL, vestry = FALSE,
  case.set = "observed", case.location = "address",
  multi.core = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pump.select}{Numeric. Vector of numeric pump IDs to define pump neighborhoods (i.e., the "population"). Negative selection possible. \code{NULL} selects all pumps.}

\item{vestry}{Logical. \code{TRUE} uses the 14 pumps from the Vestry Report. \code{FALSE} uses the 13 in the original map.}

\item{case.set}{Character. "observed" or "expected".}

\item{case.location}{Character. For observed = FALSE: "address" or "nominal". "nominal" is the x-y coordinate of \code{regular.cases}.}

\item{multi.core}{Logical or Numeric. \code{TRUE} uses \code{parallel::detectCores()}. \code{FALSE} uses one, single core. You can also specify the number logical cores. On Windows, only \code{multi.core = FALSE} is available.}
}
\value{
An R vector.
}
\description{
Plots star graph from pump to its cases.
}
\note{
This function is computationally intensive when case.set = "expected."
